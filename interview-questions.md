# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block in Ruby can be compared to the curly braces {} in JavaScript. Whenever curly braces are established in JavaScript, any line of code can be written inside. Similarly, any line of code that can be executed is written within a Ruby block but they are not established by curly braces and instead just replaced by nothing.

  Researched answer: A block in Ruby is similar to an anonymous function in JavaScript. They can be established by keywords do/end or with curly braces although the most common practice is to use the do/end keywords. Blocks are pieces of code that are passed to a method.



2. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem in Ruby is a package that can be installed that is specific for RSpec which is a testing framework for Ruby. Gem adds all the dependencies that are required for RSpec to run successfully. I like to compare gem to yarn in JavaScript.

  Researched answer: A gem is a library or snippet of code functionality. Gems package up Ruby code so it is easy to share with others. The major components of a gem include the library directory, the test or spec directory, a Rakefile, a bin directory, a README file, and a gemspec.



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a Ruby-based framework that allows for the creation of applications. Rails utilizes the MVC model which is an abbreviation for Model, View and Controller.

  Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is a server-side application framework that is written specifically in Ruby. Rails was created and released in July 2004 by Danish programmer David Heinemeier Hansson. Rails adopts a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, which provides a default structure for a database, web service, and web page. The model is the database layer, the view is what the user is able to visually see, and the controller is similar to a traffic signal that manages the interaction between the user and the application.



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is the type of database that postgreSQL utilizes. Relational databases have rows and columns and the user is able to filter out certain rows or columns based on their query criteria.

  Researched answer: A relational database is very similar to an Excel spreadsheet document with information displayed in rows and columns. A table is one set of rows and columns and a database can have a variety of tables that have relationships to each other. A schema is a description of the layout of the tables within a database and the name and data type of each column within a database.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Primary keys are rows with specific ID's so that if there are rows with the same name, the primary keys will be the determining factor in differentiating between them.

  Researched answer: In Rails, every row of a table has a primary key named "id", and that id is unique to that specific row. This prevents cases where if there are two of the same instances, they will not confused with each other since they have that unique id attached to them.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is a pattern to follow when structuring routes between the server and the client. RESTful routes are an attempt to bring the operations that can be applied to an object into HTTP requests.

2. JSON: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.

3. ERB: ERB (Embedded RuBy) is a feature of Ruby that enables you to conveniently generate any kind of text, in any quantity, from templates.

4. Params: The collection of data received by the application during a particular HTTP request.

5. API: API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software that allows two applications to talk to each other.
